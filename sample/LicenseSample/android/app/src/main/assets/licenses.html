         <h1>APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.</h1>
         <p>
           To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
           boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
           replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
           the brackets!) The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
           comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
           file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
           same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
           identification within third-party archives.

         <h1>APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.</h1>
         <p>
           To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
           boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
           replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
           the brackets!) The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
           comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
           file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
           same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
           identification within third-party archives.

         <h1>APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.</h1>
         <p>
           To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
           boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
           replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
           the brackets!) The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
           comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
           file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
           same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
           identification within third-party archives.

         <h3><em>Statement of Purpose</em></h3>
         <p>The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world
           automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights
           (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each
           and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or
           a database (each, a "Work").</p>
         <p>Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights
           to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of
           creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the
           public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
           infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works,
           reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
           whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation
           commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the
           Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
           production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to
           gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part
           through the use and efforts of others.</p>
         <p>For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and
           without any expectation of additional consideration or
           compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the
           "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of
           Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects
           to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work
           under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and
           Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
           effect of CC0 on those rights.</p>
         <p><strong>1. Copyright and Related Rights.</strong>
           A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by
           copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
           Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but
           are not limited to, the following:
         </p>
         <ol type="i">
           <li>the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform,
             display, communicate, and translate a Work;</li>
           <li> moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
             performer(s);</li>
           <li>publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's
             image or likeness depicted in a Work;</li>
           <li>rights protecting against unfair competition in regards
             to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a),
             below;</li>
           <li>rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and
             reuse of data in a Work;</li>
           <li>database rights (such as those arising under Directive
             96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
             March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under
             any national implementation thereof, including any amended
             or successor version of such directive); and</li>
           <li>other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights
             throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and
             any national implementations thereof.</li>
         </ol>
         <p><strong>2. Waiver.</strong> To the greatest extent
           permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law,
           Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
           unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
           Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims
           and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including
           existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
           the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
           maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
           (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
           future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
           purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
           advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer
           makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public
           at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
           successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be
           subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination,
           or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
           enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by
           Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
         </p>
         <p><strong>3. Public License Fallback.</strong> Should any
           part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or
           ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be
           preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
           Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
           extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each
           affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non
           sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional
           license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights
           in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
           maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
           (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
           future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
           purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
           advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The
           License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
           applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
           License for any reason be judged legally invalid or
           ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
           ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the
           License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or
           she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
           Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any
           associated claims and causes of action with respect to the
           Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement
           of Purpose.</p>
         <p><strong>4. Limitations and Disclaimers.</strong></p>
         <ol type="a">
           <li>No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are
             waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise
             affected by this document.</li>
           <li>Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no
             representations or warranties of any kind concerning the
             Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including
             without limitation warranties of title, merchantability,
             fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the
             absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present
             or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
             the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.</li>
           <li>Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of
             other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof,
             including without limitation any person's Copyright and
             Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims
             responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents,
             permissions or other rights required for any use of the
             Work.</li>
           <li>Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative
             Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or
             obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.</li>

         <p>
           To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
           boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
           replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
           the brackets!) The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
           comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
           file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
           same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
           identification within third-party archives.
